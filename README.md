### Person I design for: 
Larissa Klaassen

She has a limited view and cannot see much. She uses a screenreader and her keyboard to navigate on her computer.

### Case: 
Understanding a top athlete roster

##### Description case:
All top cyclists are sent an Excel sheet every so often containing all training schedules. This is a pretty complex sheet. And it is *color coded*. So you have to be able to see to use it. You can do better. So. Design a solution that allows Larissa to use the relevant data in a pleasant way.

## Conclusion - what have I learned?

### Design principles
##### Learn how to implement design principles in your design

I learned to implement design principles by first understanding what they are and how to use them. The first one is `Study situation`. For this principle I've thought about how the user interacts with my design. I've learned with testing how she exactly uses her keyboard. 

For the second principle `Ignore Conventions` I figured out while testing that putting the navigation always only on top is not the right choice for this user. Because she uses her keyboard it's important to keep navigation elements close no matter where she's at on the page.

By designing *with* the user instead of designing *for* them, you can create amazing things. This principle is called `Prioritize identity`. I've learned that this way of designing is way more efficient because the user has valuable input aswell. 

Last but not least, `Add nonsense`. This principle means you add little extra things to make the experience more fun. I've added a couple things such as horse photos and little sentences to make the user smile. I figured if I added too much it might get annoying because most of the times the user just wants to know her roster fast has possible without any distracting elements.

### User needs
##### Understanding user needs, and use them in your design

The first week we had a conversation with the user to really understand her needs, her context and other things that might improve my design. This corresponds to the exclusive design principles `Study situation` and `Prioritize identity`.

Each test I also discovered more things she wanted/needed. I implemented the things I learned and tested these each week. For example she wants to know when she has specific fases in her training, or what days are already booked in for the upcoming weeks.

### Testing
##### Learn how to test and use the results to make your design better

We had to test through screensharing and the webcam because the current situation with the coronavirus. It was kind of hard because you can't exactly see what the user is doing with your own eyes. To kind of make up for this the test person would say the keys she pressed and why she pressed them.

I've tested 3 times with my test person. I've learned how to test. This means comforting the test person and telling him/her it doesn't matter if something goes wrong. If something goes wrong it's good because then I know I need to change something in my design.

Each test I wrote things down I needed to change/improve for the next test. I've learned how to document each test and what I changed. The more tests I took, the better the design became.

## Reflection

I liked how we had to focus on one user during this course. This way you can design something that's perfect for that one user. It was kind of hard to do this remotely, because you can't exactly see how the user interacts with your prototype, for example with the keyboard. It would've been better if our team had managed to put another camera focusing on the keyboard. 

I think I've built a decent prototype in this given period of time with 3 user tests. I remembered some things how to test from the a previous year, for example `don't tell them exactly what to do` or `mention names of elements in the app`. But I've learned other things while remote testing, for example: tell the user she has to say what keys she's pressing on her keyboard and why. I found out testing was really important during this course.

I liked how we designed *with* the user instead of *for* the user. This way while testing 3 times *with* the user, you can iterate and improve your prototype with the results of the tests. 

Overall I think I've learned a lot. Especially how to create something for a person who's blind. This means testing with a screenreader and trying out different types of input (the keyboard).
