# Web design

### Person I design for: 
Larissa Klaassen

She has a limited view and cannot see much. She uses a screenreader and her keyboard to navigate on her computer.

### Case: 
Understanding a top athlete roster

##### Description case:
Alle topwielrenners krijgen om de zoveel tijd een Excel sheet toegestuurd waarin alle trainingsschema’s staan. Dit is een uitgebreid, complex ding. En hij is *colour coded*. Je moet dus kunnen zien om hem te kunnen gebruiken. Dat kunnen jullie beter. Dus. Ontwerp een oplossing waardoor Larissa op een prettige en manier de relevante data kan gebruiken.

## Conclusion - what have I learned?

### Design principles
##### Learn how to implement design principles in your design

I learned to implement design principles by first understanding what they are and how to use them. The first one is `Study situation`. For this principle I've thought about how the user interacts with my design. I've learned with testing how she exactly uses her keyboard. 

For the second principle `Ignore Conventions` I figured out while testing that putting the navigation always only on top is not the right choice for this user. Because she uses her keyboard it's important to keep navigation elements close no matter where she's at on the page.

By designing *with* the user instead of designing *for* them, you can create amazing things. This principle is called `Prioritize identity`. I've learned that this way of designing is way more efficient because the user has valuable input aswell. 

Last but not least, `Add nonsense`. 

### User needs
##### Understanding user needs, and use them in your design

The first week we had a conversation with the user to really understand her needs, her context and other things that might improve my design. 

Each test I also discovered more things she wanted/needed. I implemented the things I learned and tested these each week. For example she wants to know when she has specific fases in her training, or what days are already booked in for the upcoming weeks.

### Testing
##### Learn how to test and use the results to make your design better

I've tested 3 times with my test person. I've learned how to test. This means comforting the test person and telling him/her it doesn't matter if something goes wrong. If something goes wrong it's good because then I know I need to change something in my design.

Each test I wrote things down I needed to change/improve for the next test. I've learned how to document each test and what I changed. The more tests I took, the better the design became.
